Project Proposal

    My intentions for this project are to create a socialmedia blog site. 
The site will allow users to create an account and create posts as well as edit and delete post made by them.
Users will also be able to view the profiles of other user being able to friend other users and posts they have made depending on privacy settings.
Posts will be be able to consist of both text and images. Users will have a feed which will show the posts of the users friends.
